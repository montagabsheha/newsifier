<p>Full Stack Developer- Project Test. <br>Project is divided for two parts : <br>
The project was divided into two parts: <br>
1- A Part related to the api.<br>
A special repository has been created for it called &ldquo;newsifier&rdquo;.<br> 
It can be downloaded from the github and you need:<br>
Executing instruction : npm i  <br>

This section performs the process of querying the images through the api, where a new account has been registered with the image site and  <br>
the link and the privileged key are stored in the settings file in case we want to change the provider<br>
2- A Part related to cms.<br>

<br>- Executing the composer install . 
<br>instruction - Executing a php artisan migrate command to create tables <br>
- Executing the php artisan serve instruction 
<br>to run the project We do the process of registering a new user and then login, 
and then we can move to creating a new article, <br>
then we can notice that the article has a title and content that can be added through a plugin that allows adding an image by searching for it,<br>
where it connects to the first project and fetches images and chooses one of them and saves the article</p>
